                <p>Bartlett High School, part of the Bartlett City Schools system, serves students in grades 10-12 of the incorporated city of Bartlett, Tennessee. Bartlett High, formerly Nicholas Blackwell High School, has existed on this site since 1917 and encompasses 21 acres. A complete demolition and rebuilding of the school was undertaken in 1977, with additional renovations in 2001 and 2002. Freshman attend the Bartlett Ninth Grade Academy, which was established in July 2014, as part of the newly formed Bartlett City Schools. The estimated population of Bartlett is 58,000 and Bartlett High School, home of the Panthers, combined with the Ninth Grade Academy, would be the largest 9-12 high school in the State of Tennessee.</p>
